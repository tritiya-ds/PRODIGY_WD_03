# Tic-Tac-Toe_project
DESCRIPTION :
Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe Game project! This repository contains a simple, yet fun implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. The game can be played either by two players or a player and an AI on a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three of their symbols (either X or O) horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.

FEATURES :
1. Two Player Mode: Play against another person on the same device.
2. One Player vs AI Mode: Play against AI on the same device.
3. Simple Interface: Clean and intuitive user interface for easy gameplay.
4. Win Detection: Automatically detects and announces the winner.
5. Draw Detection: Detects when the game is a draw.

Thank you for checking out the Tic-Tac-Toe Game project! Enjoy playing and happy coding!
